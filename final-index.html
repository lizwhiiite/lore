  <h2>Behind the zine: expanded interviews and data</h2> <br>

<p>In America’s big liberal cities, coastal elites relish their haunted houses and cemetery tours during the Halloween season. Year-round, they bandy about theories about their flickering light bulbs or broken wine bottles or disappearing Sharpies. “I swear my apartment is haunted.” “I think there’s a ghost in my office.” <br>

But if the same coworker who sent you a link to a list of all the ghastly murders in the House of Death on 14th St told you he’s camping out in Washington State this weekend with night vision goggles and infrared cameras, trying to prove the existence of Bigfoot, he might not catch an invite to the next happy hour. <br>

People who truly believe in Bigfoot, or creatures of its ilk like Mothman, the Jersey Devil, or even the jackalope, are backwards rural folks. They’re hillbillies and white trash. They’re poor and uneducated. But are they? <br>

The Bigfoot Field Research Organization maintains a database of reported Bigfoot encounters over the past several decades, each described in detail, organized by county, and classified A, B, or C according to its plausibility. (The BFRO is also the force behind the Animal Planet show Finding Bigfoot.) The chart below compares the states with the top five highest per capita rates of encounters to the national average.<br> </p>

<h14><img src="lore10.png"></h14>

<p> Of these states and the 15 others with encounter rates above the national average, 80% also fall below national averages (as per Census data) for either educational attainment, annual income, or both.<br><p>

<h14><img src="lore11.png"></h14>

<p> <br> At first blush, the data supports the suggestion that people encountering Bigfoot aren’t high earners or college grads. Pop culture reinforces that; Finding Bigfoot features a lot of down-home folks in their flannels, drawling, “I seen a lot of bears in my day, and I can tell you this: What I saw wasn’t no bear.” <br> <br>

It’s a caricature we see in other places, too. After the 2016 election, to the tune of How could this have happened?, puff pieces about rural working-class white people started popping up. The Times got the idea to trek out to the heartland and interview Trump voters, and they haven’t stopped since. <br> <br>

But Andrea Billups, who grew up in West Virginia, says such pieces only continue to make such Americans the butt of a nationwide joke they’re not in on. <br> <br>

“You don’t know jackshit,” she says of such reporters. “You’ve been here for 48 fuckin’ hours. Hey, Junior, did you go to Brown?” <br> <br>

Billups believes in Bigfoot — like others, she refers to the species as the Forest People — and says she interacts with them regularly. She says if she won the lottery tomorrow, she would drop everything to spend the next few years in the forest with them. She also voted for Trump — and “stayed up ’til 4am on election night and laughed my ass off.” <br> <br>

Many of the sightings logged in the BFRO’s database are chance encounters — a creature running in front of a car, heavy bipedal footsteps heard outside a tent, a footprint found while hunting. But there is also a fervent, active subculture surrounding Bigfoot, or sasquatches — enthusiasts who attend conferences, summits, and expeditions where they hope to encounter a squatch or find proof the creatures exist. <br> <br>

Mainstream Bigfooters believe sasquatches are a low-population, non-aggressive primate species, a product of evolution. Their goal is to prove the existence of sasquatches to the scientific community so that the species can be studied and protected from extinction. <br> <br>

Other, fringier members of the community are known as the “woo-woo” camp. They believe sasquatches are something else entirely: a spirit alien race with the ability to perform healings, turn invisible, speak telepathically, and travel through portals. Their goal isn’t to prove anything, it’s just to interact with the Forest People and learn from them. <br> <br>

Within the community, these divides are pronounced and often create tension. But to the outside world, looking in, it can all seem the same — that is to say, equally ridiculous. Return to the scenario of your coworker telling you he’s going squatchin’ this weekend. The stigma surrounding that kind of admission, especially in academic and scientific communities, can pose a real danger to relationships and livelihoods. It’s like if your boss found out you’re a recovering addict or you practice polygamy. <br> <br>

Ron Morehead has been researching Bigfoot since 1971. He is responsible for the Sierra Sounds, the first known verified audio recordings of sasquatch vocalizations. Via email, he discussed the pushback that Bigfoot researchers face from the broader scientific community, which “ignores the subject for fear of academic ridicule, loss of tenure, or future project funding.” When he had his initial encounter decades ago with several other men, they were wary of coming forward. Their group included businessmen and board members of a megachurch — Morehead was both — and they “needed to maintain respect in the community.” <br> <br>

For Dr. Matthew Johnson, his first sighting, on a hike with his wife and young children, posed similar dilemmas. His anxieties were realized when he went public and the story blew up. A group of people he now describes as “haters and trolls” appealed to the American Board of Professional Psychology to revoke his license to practice. Dr. J, as he likes to be called, lost two patients from his private practice in the ensuing media frenzy. The appeal to the ABPP was denied, though, and Dr. J ended up gaining a new patient who was drawn to him for his honesty. <br> <br>

I’ve spent many hours on the phone with Dr. J, now a prominent and controversial figure in the community and an adherent to the “woo-woo” line of belief, hearing about a lifetime of interactions with the Forest People. I’ve spent many more hours reading the stories and witness testimonials in his hefty self-published book, Bigfoot: A 50-Year Journey Come Full Circle, of which he sent me a free copy. But we also discussed his political and religious convictions. <br> <br>

Like Billups, who has camped with Dr. J in his research area, Dr. J is conservative and Christian. He even reads the Bible to the squatches in his research area (they enjoy Paul’s epistles). I asked him if he owns a gun, and he got defensive. ”Oh, because if I own a gun I must be some sort of — ” But I told him I didn’t mean it like that. I’d want a gun too if I frequently slept on an open cot in a forest full of animals. He suggested he might need it for unfriendly humans, too, and I asked him how unfriendly a human would have to be to warrant using his gun. He readily offered a scenario in which he’d need it for self-defense if he accidentally stumbled upon a drug-growing operation. <br> <br>

Dr. J voted for Trump and thinks he’s doing a good job, but by no means does he idolize him. Dr. J says the council of sasquatch elders told him an individual must meet 3 criteria to be invited to his research area: be a good person, have a kind heart, and have an open mind. He tells me the president doesn’t meet these criteria. (Neither, however, does Hillary Clinton, who he assures me is going to jail soon — “Did you see the headlines today?” I had, but apparently not the same ones as he did.) <br> <br>

Dr. J is happily married (to his third wife), and he’s disdainful of Trump’s Stormy Daniels troubles (though he is more upset about women he says were raped by Bill Clinton). Instead, he favors the values of the VP. When it comes to hosting women at his research area, he says he takes a “Mike Pence approach.” <br> <br>

Still, it seems counterintuitive that Bigfooters tend toward the right-wing and religious. Americans think of liberals as being more “open-minded,” and believing in Bigfoot — especially the woo-woo version — definitely requires an open mind. Plus, Dr. J’s descriptions of the Forest People performing healings and speaking to him telepathically seem almost sacrilegious. Furthermore, Dr. J is, in fact, a doctor — a licensed psychologist with a background in science. <br> <br>

I asked him if he struggles to balance these three seemingly contradictory parts of his identity: politics, religion, and science. But Dr. J says they go hand in hand, perfectly. He explains that God gives the Forest People the power to heal, just as he gave it to Jesus’ disciples. He also explains that the Church invented science. It is the secular world that tries to convince us that the two are in conflict. <br> <br>

Professor Mark Wilson of Wooster University teaches a seminar class on the American fixation with what he calls “nonsense,” including folklore, pseudoscience, and conspiracy theories. Asked via email if there is a single factor to which he attributes the popularity of “nonsense,” he writes: <br> <br>

“I used to think this one was easy — education, or rather the lack of it. This puts me and the education establishment in the heroic role of bringing the Enlightenment to the benighted and improving their lives. Now, of course, seeing the recalcitrance of nonsense and the rise of a ‘post-truth’ society, I know it is much more than just a dearth of information. I now think nonsense’s popularity is either caused by or a cause of the decline of intellectual authority. The burst of information accessibility means that anyone can be his or her own expert — every man a priest, in the old calculus. Why listen to professors, scientists and journalists when Google is right there to give you a choice of what you can believe?” <br> <br>

In other words, he correlates the rise of nonsense directly to the corrosive effects of the digital age on the relationship between “gatekeepers” (be they journalists or academics) and the public. I recall Dr. J talking earnestly about Pizzagate. <br> <br>

With that, the distance between believing in God and believing in Bigfoot doesn’t seem so impassable. After all, where does the line between folklore and religion begin to blur? It’s acceptable to believe in guardian angels, but we draw the line at — what? — the Yeti? <br> <br>

Wilson agrees there’s a double standard. One of Dr. J’s Bigfoot healings is no different from a healing at a Catholic shrine like Lourdes: “Both are based on superstition; both lack real evidence.” Still, in Wilson’s curriculum, he tries to steer clear of religion. He says he picks his battles. “Once I publicly question God or gods,” he writes, “people stop listening.” <br> <br>

Folklore isn’t mere “fake news,” though, and its existence long precedes the Internet, dating back to beliefs of indigenous peoples and beyond. Google Trends doesn’t exhibit any marked upward trend in “Bigfoot” searches over the past decade, even as social media use and alternative news outlets have exploded. The only major spike was in August 2008, when two men infamously faked the discovery of a Bigfoot corpse. The same goes for a search like “ghosts”; it spikes up annually in October, but otherwise remains fairly steady. <br> <br>

There’s no doubt that social media gives believers a space to congregate (Dr. J runs a Facebook group called “Team Squatchin’ USA,” with over 10k members), and that the Internet allows users to access information that used to have to be shared orally or picked up and fact checked by a newspaper. But the Internet didn’t start the fire. It’s just the gasoline that helps it spread and feed. <br> <br>

Here’s what Google Trends does demonstrate. Below are the 5 states with the highest concentration (on Google’s scale of 0–100) of searches for “Bigfoot”: <p> <br>

<h14><img src="lore12.png"></h14>

<p> Sans Alaska, every state here has Bigfoot sighting rates above the national average, so it makes sense that they’re Googling squatches more too. By this logic, most Googling of more urban folklore (people-phenomenon rather than creature-phenomenon), will take place in states like New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. But here’s the same chart for Google searches of “ghosts”: <br> <p>

<h14><img src="lore13.png"></h14>

<br> <p> Sans North Dakota, these, too, are all major Bigfoot states. All 5 fall below the national average for either income, college degrees, or both. And just like every state on the Bigfoot graph except Washington, all 5 voted for Trump in 2016. <br> <br>

Similar states top the subregions searching most for terms like “aliens,” “sasquatch,” Loch Ness Monster,” and “Mothman,” and have the highest concentrations of people asking Google, “Is Bigfoot real?”, “Are ghosts real?”, and even “Is God real?” This includes states like Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky — all of which also appear in the top 5 subregions searching “Is Barack Obama Muslim?” The Venn diagram of the top 5 states asking each of these questions and states that voted for Trump is a circle. <br> <br>

Below are some of the members of Dr. J’s Team Squatchin’ USA, 10,000 strong. Facebook tells me that only 12 live in New York City. <br> <p>

<p> <br> Billups told me I can’t really understand Bigfoot culture unless I go to the woods and experience it. She’s a journalism professor in Florida (she acknowledges herself as an outcast in a profession “full of liberals”), and that’s what she did: flew to Southern Oregon to spend 4 days at Dr. J’s research area. Her implication is that to do less makes one no better than the reporters doing drive-bys in flyover states — or, for that matter, Hillary Clinton, who Billups said “didn’t get off her ass” to go campaign in West Virginia. <br> <br>

Maybe she is right. Just like rural folks know better than we do about what kinds of creatures are living in the woods, poor white Trump voters know better than we do about the grievances of poor white Trump voters. <br> <br>

Partially because of her inside view of the journalism industry, Billups is leery of “the media,” an entity that lately reduces people like her father, a West Virginian with an eighth grade education, to a quote hemmed in by tongue-in-cheek acknowledgments to the reader that they, too, find their subject bemusing or pitiable. I can hear the caution in the tones of all the Bigfoot believers I speak to, whether they’re talking about squatchin’ or Donald Trump. They’re unapologetic, and they believe what they’re saying, but they know I’m a writer from New York City who’s “working on a piece.” They’re afraid that I’m trying to make them look stupid. <br> <br>

Professor Angus Gillepsie teaches folklore at Rutgers University. Speaking on the phone about the purpose of folklore in Americans’ lives and why it endures, Gillepsie cites three factors: nostalgia, entertainment, and practical value. Nostalgia: folklore is passed from “father to son, mother to daughter.” It connects us to our ancestors and to our more primitive selves. Entertainment: storytelling is “rewarding for listener and for teller.” It’s fun. <br> <br>

Then there’s the practical side. Gillepsie uses the Jersey Devil as an example. For those unfamiliar, the Jersey Devil is a demonic creature said to stalk the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The way I heard the story when I was little, the Jersey Devil was the thirteenth child conceived by a woman called Mother Leeds. Upset by the prospect of another pregnancy, poor Mother Leeds cursed the child, saying he was the devil. Sure enough, he was born with hooves and wings, killed the midwife, and now haunts the Pine Barrens. <br> <br>

The Jersey Devil serves the same purpose as the Boogeyman or even Santa Claus — scaring children into good behavior. It provides a convincing incentive for kids to stay close to the campsite and be good for Mom and Dad. It works on adults, too. Centuries ago, Jersey Lightning, a kind of apple brandy, was manufactured in the Pine Barrens, where legends of the Devil dissuaded revenue agents from poking around. Similarly, ships that didn’t want to pay customs would dock by the Pine Barrens and smuggle their goods to New York via Conestoga wagons. It seems very Scooby Doo, to protect your illegal operation by cooking up a supernatural villain. But it plays to our basest instincts, and it works. <br> <br>

Sometimes, asking How does this function? is more useful than asking Is this real? Meaning lies in the how and why, not the yes or no. “The important thing,” Gillepsie told me, “is not whether the story is true or false, but just that there is a story.” <p>
